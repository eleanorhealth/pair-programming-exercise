# 2) Unread Messages Tag

## User Story (same as Story 1)

> As an Eleanor Health clinical staff person,

> When I am viewing my Member List,

> I want to be able to see if there are messages I haven't read,

> So that I can keep in consistent contact.

## Existing Behavior

Member records are pulled from an API (https://randomuser.me), and displayed in rows in the app.

Story #1 implemented `countUnreadMessages`.

## Feature Requirements

1. An `<UnreadMessageTag />` should display near each member name. This component already exists, but is not yet rendered anywhere.
2. The tag should indicate the number of unread messages, example: "2 Unread Messages"
3. Don't worry about styling for this story.
4. Users with zero unread messages should not have a tag.
5. Users with one unread message should have the word "Message" instead of "Messages."
